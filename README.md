# rotating_navigation
Part of a week of projects

-------------

- On this project, the purpose was show a navbar in a different way that we was used to see

<div>
    <img alt"normal" src="https://imgur.com/tVKlX5G.png" />
</div>

###

- And it's totally responsive as you see on the example below

<div>
    <img alt"normal" src="https://i.imgur.com/8CLs2nL.png" />
</div>

#### What happen if I click to open navbar??
- I'll show you!!
<div>
    <img alt"normal" src="https://i.imgur.com/2I7Eqke.png" />
</div>
